# eye-tracker-hackathon
eye-tracker-hackathon is a playful desktop project where a digital “eye” appears on the screen and continuously follows the movement of the computer cursor. Instead of tracking human eyes, this project simulates an animated eye that reacts to cursor position, creating an interactive and engaging user experience.
